# Project-Archive
An Archive to show off my personal and official projects/programms

# Why?
I'v always wanted a place to showoff all my projects and things i program in my freetime so i made this website where i 
could even add more stuff in the Future!

#How it works:
For now the login page has no particular function and acts as an placeholder so when i get to implement the backend
i can use this login.
on the main page there are panels with the name and description of the project that act as links so that when you click on them
you get redirected to the dedicated page of the Project.

#The Projects:
#Mo's Formelsammlung
Mo's formelsammlung is a place where you will be able to upload different mathematical formulars so that you can access them
when you need to.
#HAZ3 Multitool
HAZ3 Multitool is a batch written script that has many features such a IP Geolocator or an IP Generator, for experimental uses only ;)
