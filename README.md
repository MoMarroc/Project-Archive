# Project-Archive
An Archive to show off my personal and official projects/programms

# Why?
I'v always wanted a place to showoff all my projects and things i program in my freetime so i made this website where i 
could even add more stuff in the Future!

#How it works:
For now the login page has no particular function and acts as an placeholder so when i get to implement the backend
i can use this login.
on the main page there are panels with the name and description of the project that act as links so that when you click on them
you get redirected to the dedicated page of the Project.

##The Projects:
